## 🚀 **What I’m working on:**

### **Audemy** 🎮🐛📚
I founded **Audemy**, an educational game platform for **blind students** that creates interactive, audio-based games. Right now, I’m focused on improving and scaling the platform, which has already helped over **3,000 users** around the world. I lead a team of **50+ volunteers** and we’ve raised **$100,000 in grants**. We’ve already impacted **1 in 50 blind kids** and are working on expanding even more. 

### **HCI Research** 🧑‍🔬🔥🗣
At **SRL** (Sketch Recognition Lab) at **Texas A&M**, I research whatever I find interesting and that can help people! Most of my work is focused on improving **user experience** for **blind and visually impaired individuals**, especially in the **education space**.
